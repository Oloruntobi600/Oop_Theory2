/*
A Constructor is a special type of method that is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class is created.
Its primary purpose is to initialize the newly created object, setting initial values for its attributes or performing
any other setup tasks necessary for the object to be in a valid state.
Constructors play a crucial role in object initialization, ensuring that objects are properly initialized before they
are used. They help establish the initial state of objects, making them ready for operation.
Constructors do not return a value. They are used solely for initializing the object.
Constructors are used to initialize the state of objects. They can initialize instance variables, set up
initial conditions, allocate resources, or perform any other necessary setup tasks.
Example:
public class Car {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
